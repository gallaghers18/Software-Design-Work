# Software-Design-Work

Projects from Spring of 2018.

Webapp is the project mentioned on my resume. It consists of a database of hockey stats, an API to draw from it, and a website to format and display the information.

Final Project is a traffic simulator made using javafx, under a model-view controller model.
